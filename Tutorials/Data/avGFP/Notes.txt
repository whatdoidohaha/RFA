Poelwijk, F.J., Socolich, M. & Ranganathan, R. Learning the pattern of epistasis linking genotype and phenotype in a protein. Nat Commun 10, 4213 (2019).

Complete sampling of binary sequence space over 13 sites in a fluorescent protein.

Derived genotype: row 8,192.

Two replicate measurements; fluorescence in second replicate systematically higher (by a factor of 1.31); this bias was corrected for when averaging the replicates (Poelwijk et al. only used replicate 1); r2 = 0.980.
