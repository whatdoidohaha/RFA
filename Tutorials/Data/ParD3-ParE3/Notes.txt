Aakre C.D., et al., Evolving New Protein-Protein Interaction Specificity through Promiscuous Intermediates. Cell 163(3):594-606 (2015).

Four sites in the protein ParD3 mutated and assayed for binding to two proteins, ParE2 and ParE3, in bulk growth competition assay.

Only a subset of possible mutant amino acids sampled; total 9,360 variants.

Wild type genotype: LWDK (row 1,298).

Sampling:

ParE2: 9323/9360 (99.6%)
ParE3: 9194/9360 (98.2%)

Two replicate experiments; r2 = 0.94 for ParE2 and 0.98 for ParE3.

Amino acids numbered by the alphabetical order of the single-letter abbreviation.
